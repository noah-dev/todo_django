# Intro:
My name is Noah - I'm an aspiring developer and this is one of my side projects. This readme document will cover the why, how, and the what. **Why I built this, How I built this, and What I accomplished.**

# Why build a TODO app?
Although the business logic is pretty straight forward, I saw it as a great opportunity to learn front-end skills. This includes:
* Building a responsive(-ish) site using Bootstrap.
* Designing clean, stylish designs using CSS & Bootstrap
* Using AJAX requests to update content on the page
* Adding animations via CSS Transitions & jQuery code

Although at the outset I didn't know much of the above, I did know there were a ton of resources to help me in implementing the features & feel I wanted. Django, HTML/CSS/JS & jQuery all have big communities, enabling me to learn and build quicker. 

# How does it work?
**UML Diagram**
In broad strokes, the three most key players are the user (the person), the front end (html/css/js) and the back end (django).

As shown in the diagram, there are four ways a user can interact with the app. I will breifly cover how this looks; if you are interested in more granualarity, check the appendix.
